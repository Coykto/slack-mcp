# Test Channels

These channels were created during Slice 6 integration testing and are kept for future use.

## Public Channel
- **Name:** `mcp-test-public-20251130-1`
- **ID:** `C0A0E6MHBJP`
- **Members:** Bot (Brewster), @ebasmov

## Private Channel
- **Name:** `mcp-test-private-20251130-1`
- **ID:** `C0A1ETF1DCY`
- **Members:** Bot (Brewster), @ebasmov

Both channels have the `[managed by slack-mcp]` marker in their purpose, meaning they are MCP-managed and can be used for idempotent operations.
